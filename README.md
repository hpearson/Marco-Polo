# Marco-Polo
Marco Polo was developed in 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2016. (01/31/2016)<br />
This project was to create a video game that Helen Keller could play. Marco Polo is a game that is playable by the blind and deaf. Players can play by holding the Sega CD console. The CD drive is spun up and down to provide haptic feedback. Chirp sounds are provided if the player is visually impaired.
<br /><br />
Macro Polo has three game modes. On startup, the user selects the game mode by pressing A, B, or C.<br />
    A) A copy of Argisub without visuals.<br />
    B) A morse code teaching program.<br />
    C) A morse code matching game.<br />
Players can learn more code using program B.<br />
Once the players are familiar with Morse code they can play C a morse code matching game. <br />
<br ><br />
The game is programmed in BASIC and is compiled using BasiEgaXorz.
